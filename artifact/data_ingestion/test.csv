13815231,"Jennifer: I will have to give a presentation on global warming on Friday, and I am so nervous.
Mary: There are a lot of things you can do to make you feel more confident and less nervous.
Jennifer: What should I do, Mary?
Mary: First of all, you need to understand the subject matter thoroughly. You need to know what is global warming, what causes global warming, and what people should do to abate the effects of global warming.
Jennifer: I have done a lot of research on the subject, and I know I can answer any questions I will receive from the audience.
Mary: The next thing that you need is an outline of your presentation. You should think about how to effectively present the subject matter.
Jennifer: You mean what I should talk about, or more precisely the sequence of my presentation?
Mary: Yes, what you should present first, second, third…
Jennifer: If that is the case, then I already have an outline. To make it easy for my audience to follow the presentation, I intend to post the outline on the board at all time during my speech.
Mary: Good idea! By the way, do you have any facts to back you up? For example, change of climate, yearly disasters…
Jennifer: No, I have not thought about that. I better get some statistics from the Internet. I should not have any problems since the Internet has all kinds of data.
Mary: Good. It is easier to convince people and to hold their attention with actual data. It would be even better if you show some pictures along the way. Do you have any?
Jennifer: No, it is another thing to add to my To Do list. I guess I will need at least two or three pictures to persuade people about the dangers of global warming.
Mary: Pictures will keep your audience from being bored. In order for you to succeed, you need to keep them interested and involved.
Jennifer: What else do I need? Is there anything else I can do to help me relax and be at ease during my presentation?
Mary: You need to practice your presentation. Just pretend that you are standing in front of your audience and start to give your speech.
Jennifer: Pretending is one thing; actually giving a speech is another thing.
Mary: Think positive. Tell yourself that you can do it without any problems.
Jennifer: I guess I can look at this as a presentation of my point of view to my friends.
Mary: If you are really prepared, it will be a piece of cake. You will be able to speak with ease and confidence, and you will be amazed by how well you can express yourself.
Jennifer: I need to do this presentation really well. This is my first presentation in front of a big audience, and it is so important to me.
Mary: This is only the beginning, Jennifer. Being able to express your ideas with confidence and clarity is one of the best skills to possess.
Jennifer: You are absolutely right. I will take time to practice and to learn to relax and express myself really well. Wish me luck, Mary!
Mary: I know you. You can do it. Good luck, Jennifer!",Mary instructs Jennifer on how to prepare a presentation on global warming. Jennifer will give the presentation on Friday. It'll be her first with such a vast audience.

Karen: You should quit eating gluten and see, otherwise you should look for a different explanation. Maybe it has nothing to do with food?
Charles: I had a basic blood test and everything's fine. My GP said all my problems are linked to my diet
Karen: It may be, but I'm not so sure. Although, changing your diet and eating healthier can't do you any harm

George: True. I can’t afford the plane tickets.
Jane: I understand, not your fault! 
George: Sorry!
Jane: It’s okay; I just want to get your thoughts on mom. Should we try to hire someone to look in on her daily? Move her laundry to the upstairs? What do you think?
George: I think we should definitely try to avoid having the laundry on a different floor or get a stair lift or something. Which is cheaper?
Jane: I think a stair lift is a few thousand, but so would a plumbing job and getting a stackable that would fit upstairs. About even, in other words. Not sure what she’ll go for. Probably neither!
George: She might go for the lift then. Keeps everything pretty much the same.
Jane: True.
George: What about getting someone to check on her?
Jane: I was thinking the neighbor. She’s retired and I’d offer to pay her to pop in once a day and have coffee, keep her company. Can you help out with the cash?

Jane: I know!
George: Good thing you were dropping by anyway. How long did she lay there?
Jane: Not long, an hour or so. Long enough!
George: She must have been scared. I’ll call her later. Do they let her have her phone?
Jane: Yes, but it may need to be charged. Call the hospital and ask for 2231.
George: Okay.
Jane: Speak soon. Love you!
George: Love you too and thanks again!","Jane and George's mother fell and had a bad sprain trying to catch herself. George hasn't seen mum long due to expensive plane tickets.

Fred: Exactly. Because he says exactly what he thinks would bring him support. But as Internet does not forget that few years ago he wanted to close the mines, he has less chance that someone would believe him and trust him. 
Fred: And trustworthy politician is a winning politician.
George: Ok. I get it. Still idk why you engage in this, and at this point I'm afraid to ask :P",Fred gathers proof of politicians' hypocrisy on the Internet. George questions why Fred does it.

13829857,"Ida: Hey! I need a little bit of your help. :D I was in Hamburg for almost 5 months and I wanted to post a short text for all my friends and peoplewho made me feel better in a new place.

Nancy: Hey! Of course - no problem :D Just send me what you wrote and I'll look through it ;)
Nancy: How are you btw?
Ida: Its time to say good bye! During my Hamburg experience I had fun, I worked hard and I took a lot of walks in the harbour. I also realised that #Fischbrotchen and milkshake are not a perfect match. But most of all - I met incredible, inspiring and freindly people who gave me the best memories. Thanks for everyone, who made me smile! + special thanks for my sister who survived 5 months with me and my Netflix obsession.
Ida: Thanks a lot: Here it is (some cheesy jokes included, but I didnt want to sound too pompous XD )
Ida: I'm fine, tomorrow I'm leaving Germany ;) But i miss France actually :D What about you? Still studying in Bordeaux? ;)
Nancy: Hey, I couldn't answer you straight away - here are my corrections:
Nancy: It's time to say... It's = it is; Its = possessive form of it, meaning ""of it"". 2 examples  - 'The building was missing its windows.' and 'it's a lovely day outside!'
Nancy: ""Goodbye"", not ""good bye"" ;)
Nancy: This is such a petty thing for me to correct, but here goes - ""During my Hamburg experience , I had fun..."" (what can I say? Commas are important too :P )
Nancy: I took a lot of walks *on* the harbour - just like you would say: ""I took a walk on the beach"" not ""in the beach""
Nancy: Milkshakes - plural (especially since you next write: milkshakes *are* not ""is"")
Nancy: Thanks everyone who made me smile - the ""for"" isn't needed, if anything, ""thanks to everyone"" is preferred. And *a* special thanks *to* my sister - again, ""to"" not ""for""
Nancy: And that's about it :P Hopefully this makes sense ;) But other than some really minor mistakes, I would say that you're in pretty good shape language-wise 
Ida: I had a great teacher ;) 
Ida: Thank you very much! <3 Even in French I double-check what I write if it goes public XD
Nancy: You're very welcome :) To answer your earlier question, I'm doing okay - it's been a bit bsy at the moment, but nothing I can't handle :P WHat have you been doing in Germany?
Ida: I did an internship at About You! Do you know this company? It's pretty new in Europe. So I was taking care of the french market
Ida: Do you have exam session? o.O
Nancy: That's great Ida! I haven't heard of it, but it sounds like you learned a lot and had fun :)

Personally, the Bible aligns with my perception of morality. The Bible is like a guidebook for our lives. The more you follow it's principles, the better your life will be, and you'll be blessed by God.
Heather: If the Bible is so right, then why are there just as many muslims?
Barry: I can't answer that question. God has a plan for this world, and sometimes we just have to accept the fact that we can't know all the answers. I put my faith in God and the Bible.

Anne: Thanks a lot! I was thinking about Angelo's as well, but it happens that my cousin is Italian so I think it may be a bit risky to impress him with an Italian restaurant ;)
Carl: Fair point. What about Toff's? They are famous for having the best fish and chips in the UK.
Anne: Haven't heard about them! Where are they?
Carl: Third zone, near Highgate. The area is beautiful, really worth going, especially if someone's never been to London.
Sarah: If you're looking for something more central, I highly recommend Yori. It's a Korean restaurant, a true gem <3
Anne: What are the prices? It's not that we are really on a budget here, but wouldn't mind saving some for more touristic stuff ;)
Sarah: Cool, I find Yori affordable and their prive-value is really high in my opinion.
Carl: Same for the Toff's, they mainly sell fish and fish and chips, so maybe check with your cousin if he likes it first.
Anna: Oh, I bet he'd love to have an Instagram worthy photo with a fish and chips in London, hahaha!
Tom: If I were you, I'd focus on the bars more ;) Take him to Soho, skip the fancy ones though.
Anna: That goes without a question! Have a few places in mind already. He also has a sweet tooth, so I was thinking maybe Hummingbird?
Sarah: I think I may be joining you for that one! If not, take the salted caramel for my sake.
Anna: Always! I always go for the red velvet, even if Tom thinks it's overrated.
Tom: Because it is, it's just a normal cake with red dye in it.
Sarah: So Tom is definitely not going to Hummingbird with us :D Party pooper :P
Carl: How long is your cousin staying?
Anna: Four days so that's four lunches/dinners - waiting for your recommendations!

Sarah: But never on a weekend! Unless you fancy getting stomped or like to waiting for your food like FOREVER. When is he coming?

Dennis: Never been there myself but it's on my itinerary. What's it like?
Laura: A bit tough, truth to tell, but you'd like it. Abject living conditions for local people but we're in a ""touristy"" cocoon, so one easily overlooks the other side. Splendid landscapes, incredible architecture but in a more than sorry state of preservation. I love and hate to be here at the same time.
Dennis: So you aren't travelling alone, I presume.
Laura: No, my travelling companion takes me along, so to speak, to his winter quarters, since his health doesn't cope that well with European winters. I couldn't afford these travels entirely on my own of course.
Dennis: Always thought Cuba is not expensive. Especially the post-Fidel Cuba.
Laura: Just the contrary. In the good old days when it was supported by the Soviet Union, the living standard was not bad and they didn't have to rely on income from tourism. Then it all went down the drain, even famine and food rationing have become their daily thing. Since early 00s most not rationed goods are available only for CUC, their convertible currency. The bottom line being that whatever you buy as a tourist, you pay +/- western prices.
Dennis: So how much do you two spend daily?
Laura: Staying in private houses about at least 100€, including food, transport and entrance fees. These days we are compelled to stay at a state-run Hotel and pay thru the nose - 130€ a night. No, Cuba is not cheap. But Havana Club YES.
Dennis: Don't like the stuff at all.
Laura: Me neither. Gives me headaches. Even one glass of it.
Dennis: What you say will make me think twice before setting sail for Cuba.
Laura: But it can be fantastic as well. Eg Vinales Valley in the west, with its horse-riding trips, wild camping and pure nature.
Dennis: Sounds better. I'll ask you for details.
Dennis: Anyway enjoy your trip as much as you can. Happy trails toyou two!

13716802,"Matthew: any of those on here talking about watching videos, listening to tunes or laughing at stuff have clearly never had a full on impending doom, thought looping, time dilated, paranoid, depersonalization attack from doing too much weed. 
Matthew: I know at least 2 people who have suffered protracted post hallucinogen perception disorder from cannabis use and many others who spend their days in a zombified apathetic state smoking it all day.. 
Matthew: it is not a remotely harmless drug despite all the people on here trying to be edgy and cool... i’d goes as far as saying LSD and psilocybin are safer mentally.
Rick: Have you been watching Reefer Madness?
Robert: Matthew, ahhh or we just had that sober as children and moved past it like normal folks eventually realizing that we are going to die and doom is impending and that’s fine.
Basia: Psilocybin is famously extremely safe, so yes, it's very possible that it and LSD are both safer than marijuana. Nevertheless, the risk of serious problems from moderate marijuana use is pretty low for most healthy adults. Not zero risk, but pretty low risk for _most_ people.
Rick: Matthew, I only heard of positive effects of marijuana: relax, unwind, de-stress, relax, unwind, de-stress...
Daniel: Basia, healthy adults are low risk true but most peer reviewed studies show a high risk in users 21 and under.Easy to get caught up in the debate always trust the science.
Seamie: Matthew, You're clueless
Matthew: Huh?","According to Matthew marihuana is unsafe, while Rick heard otherwise. Basia confirms that it's worse for mental health than LSD."

It showed three different ""pathways"" you could try and approach your future academic career with. the 1) ""do a post doc with a bigger project supervised by a PI"" approach, the 2) ""Independent Research Fellowship (=be your own PI)"" approach and the do first one and then the other approach.. The general rule seemed to be that you had to have at least 2 publications to get a Fellowship(option2), but that your skills might be more important to be hired in the option1-approach. And, obviously: there is a tradeoff between using the time to finish your phd, to publish papers and to apply for independent research fellowship/project-funded post-docs.

Martha: Give me a sec.

Martha: An interesting article indeed. I still think the whole idea of that conflict is a bit blown out of proportion to control the masses. Us vs them. In reality, both China and the US are capably of being fully independent.
Peter: I agree to a certain extent.
Martha: Elaborate please
Peter: The ""we have to create  a state of permanent threat for people to need us"" approach but as a historian I know everything works in cycles of war.
Martha: There are plenty of wars out there. And they are both so huge that their internal doings should be fully sustainable. Plus the US makes enormous profit on arms industry. 
Peter: If you want profit from arms industry, you need wars. More wars = more profit
Martha: I just think the conflict wouldn't make sense from an economic standpoint. And as much of a crackpot Trump is, he realizes that.
Peter: We're talking about the same Trump who refused meeting with Putin at the g20 summit after Russia attacked the Ukraine?
Martha: I honestly believe they discuss their issues behind closed doors. Known each other for years.
Peter: Yes, but had the meet happened, he would've had to condemn Putin on an international arena. So he remedied the situation by avoiding it completely.
Martha: That doesn't matter. It's just PR stunts anyway. Mostly. And the US doesn't really care about Europe
Peter: They never have. But they have quite a large influence on Us policies
Martha: That doesn't really matter either. It's not the government who will decide but corporate lobbyists. 
Peter: Yes but if they feel like they want to retain control they will just need an excuse to start something
Martha: Not without business support. It's all about making money anyway, what does ""power"" even mean anymore?
Peter: Power always needs conflict",Peter and Martha discuss world politics after Peter sends Martha an article. Martha doesn't think that the US will go to war as it's not profitable. Peter believes that certain groups might push for an armed conflict to profit more. Peter believes history works in cycles of war.

Diana: Great! Thanks for replying so quickly :)
Diana: I was browsing your website and looking for different opportunities. I am particularly interested in Asia and Northern America, my only problem is that I don't speak other language than English
Chris: Ok, it doesn't necessarily mean that you won't be eligible to participate in projects in other countries. Especially in Asia we have a lot of opportunities for people who would like to teach English
Diana: That's great news! Won't it be a problem that I'm not a teacher? I don't have any experience
Chris: It all depends on what you would like to do, are you interested in being a volunteer or in something paid?
Diana: I'm interested in travelling that's for sure, so I really want to go somewhere. If you have something that will allow me to get paid for my work and will be in line with my experience, that'd be absolutely wonderful.
Diana: I'm open for being a volunteer as well - the only problem's that I may not be able to afford to pay for the accommodation.
Chris: Most of the organisations we're cooperating with cover the cost of the accommodation of our volunteers. You usually pay for a plane ticket and food. Certain organisations offer pocket money
Diana: Yes, I saw one really interesting offer from Japan. They're looking for someone who could teach English in high school, although they listed some nationalities - didn't mention British, quite surprising in my opinion. Does it mean that I can't apply?
Chris: Could you please send me a link? We have a lot offers and it'd be easier for me to advice you if I know the offer
Diana: Sure <file_other>
Chris: Thanks!
Chris: Okay, so, I think in this case it shouldn’t be a problem. You may not be regarded as a preferred candidate, but I don’t think that you’re not eligible. Also, if you’re really interested, I’ll gladly contact the organisers and ask if they are interested in your profile.
Diana: That would be amazing! Thank you Chris!
Chris: If this one doesn’t work out, and please, be aware that we’re in touch with people all over the world so it may happen that you won’t get the job you applied for, are you interested in another position?
Diana: I think I’ll be happy to participate in any project in Japan (as a volunteer or not), unless it’s related to computers, IT, technology, etc. as I have absolutely no clue about that stuff
Chris: And what about North America? You mentioned that you may be interested in this as well
Diana: Yes, I think it’s pretty much the same as with Japan. I’m not too keen on being a teacher at a camp, but everything other than that would be great
Chris: Got it! I will look for something suitable. May you send me your CV?
Diana: <file_other>
Chris: Thanks! If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask :)
Diana: Thank you! I really appreciate your help Chris. The whole idea is brilliant, but I admit it’s a bit overwhelming and confusing especially as you’re new to the whole thing
Chris: No worries, I've heard that a lot and we're doing everything we can to facilitate the process and make it more user friendly
Chris: We also highly recommend everyone to visit us in one of our offices, so if you live in London, I'll be happy to meet you
Diana: Perfect!",Chris is working with the AIESEC. Diana is interested in AIESEC's projects in Asia and Northern America. She sent Chris an offer in which they are looking for an English teacher in high school in Japan. Chris will contact the organisers on behalf of Diana and will let her know what their answer is.

Lucas: I did it once, I'm telling you, it's a scam - paid a lot of money, never saw the ticket or my money back
Victoria: I'm looking for tickets for Mumford and Sons, but they're gone everywhere :( Thanks for the warning though
Victoria: It was the only page that had them available - in good price. I also found some on Viagogo, have you heard about it?
Daniel: Huh, I did. I had the same problem with Guns'n'Roses concert last year, there were only some tickets left on Viagogo and I bought two - it was a scam as well
Lucas: They have legit tickets sometimes, some of my friends used it before, but it's nothing sure. It didn't work for me
Patricia: Yeah, I had a problem with Viagogo as well. I don't know how it works really, but I got scammed as well. Buying tickets from people on Facebook worked better for me

Patricia: Find the official event of the concert and ask around. Maybe some people can't come and they're already selling their tickets
Daniel: It's risky as well, but I think it's better than some dodgy website. On Facebook you at least have the name of the person who's selling
Patricia: It's also good when you can buy a ticket from someone who's from the same city - you can just meet and exchange
Lucas: Yeah, so someone won't wander off with your money!
Victoria: Why it has to be so difficult? :(((
Victoria: I'll try it out guys, thanks!

Patricia: An hour?! Wow, that's quick!
Patricia: When I was buying tickets for Ed Sheeran I was refreshing the page 30 minute before it started
Daniel: It is a pain, but I think it's a trend now - you buy tickets a year before the event, otherwise you're stuck with dodgy solutions
Victoria: I'll let you know if I find some tickets, already posted in Facebook that I'm looking for two, at least one :)
Lucas: Good luck! Be careful though ;)","Victoria is looking for tickets for Mumford and Sons' concert. They're officially sold out so she's browsing some dubious websites like Viagogo. Patricia, Lucas and Daniel warn her against doing it and they suggest looking for the tickets on Facebook. "

My sister had just taken a bad fall in the bathroom hitting her L lower rib cage against an edge of a bathtub and is experiencing general pain. She doesn't think she's broken anything. Would you think it might be something demanding medical attention?
Peter: Good evening Tim, I'm still in bed reading, Emma is asleep, so I'll stick to writing. Firstly, sorry to hear that but don't worry. If she can still move and talk, it can't be too bad. She doesn't spit blood, does she?
Tim: No.
Peter: Is the impacted area swollen?
Tim: No.
Peter: BTW when did it happen?
Tim: Not more than an hour ago.
Peter: Is she alone? Sorry I mean immediate help if her condition deteriorated.
Tim: She lives alone. Her next door neighbours are just across the yard but I don't think they would be much help, being old themselves.
Peter: Do you think she'll be capable of phoning in case of an urgent need?
Tim: I should think so. Well, she texted me after the accident.
Peter: While you talked to her, was she lucid?
Tim: We couldn't talk because of my wife and the baby in the same room. She also preferred to write, since, as I suppose, it was less painful that talking. And yes – she was absolutely lucid.
Peter: Of course I cannot say anything definite without examining her but judging by the symptoms you've described I'd tend to say that it's just soreness due to the impact of the fall. But she has to observe her body.
Tim: Exactly what I told her! Should she see a doctor?
Peter: She might if she feels worse. What she may need, however, are painkillers. Tell your sister not to hesitate to take painkillers. Even strong ones. For that she may need a prescription.
Tim: Will they advise me at the drugstore when I describe the case? Anything over the counter?
Peter: If you're going to get them for her, take IBU-ratiopharm 400 g, 20 pills, and 10 pills of the same but 600 g. She may want to start with the stronger one.
Peter: Yes, they're available over the counter.
Tim: It's so generous of you to let me have all this advice at this late hour. I really appreciate it, Peter. Thank you very much.
Peter: Really nothing to thank for. Glad I could help. Let me know how she's doing.

Tom: Do you think it's populist?
Tom: That's what they always say in media
Theo: I'm not sure, they're demanding more justice, I can't see populists elements in it
Jimmy: I really don't like the word populism

Theo: I read a Guardian article about it some times ago, they tried to built a definition of it
Jimmy: and how did they define it?
Theo: <file_other> ""Populism is usually described as a strategic approach that frames politics as a battle between the virtuous, “ordinary” masses and a nefarious or corrupt elite"".
Jimmy: Yes, but that's actually quite a lib-cons vision, because aren't we in a kind of struggle between an ""elite"" and ordinary people?
Jimmy: with all the tax evaders, corporations, growing inequalities? 
Theo: maybe you're right
Jimmy: it's not surprising that people want a change
Theo: The only stupid thing is that then they vote for Trump, Salvini and Orban
Jimmy: Exactly, so maybe we should call ""populism"" all the parties, politicians, movements that promise to address the inequalities and problems, but actually make them worse or focus on even less privileged groups (refugees, unemployed, immigrants, minorities) and blame them for the problems... which of course makes problems only worse
Theo: haha, that's a much better definition than that of the guardian, I think
Jimmy: hahah, thanks",Theo explains to Tom that the recent prostests in France were motivated by high fuel prises and costs of living. Jimmy and Theo debate over the nature of the concept of populism.

Victoria: I guess. But are they planning to recruit new people?
Chris: hahaha, no, what for ;)
Victoria: Of course :D It seems like our companies have a lot in common.
Chris: Again, I'm happy that the business's booming, we have work, money, etc. I wouldn't mind also having life to spend all this fortune.
Victoria: Tell me about it. Same thing happened here last year. They don't want to hire new people, because what if projects end?
Chris: I get that, but I know plenty of people happy to help temporarily. I've talked with my manager already, no luck though.
Victoria: I tried that as well. I honestly don't get this kind of policy. How many projects do you have now?
Chris: Supervising two, cooperating on five and three that I'm working on on my own. So ten in total.
Victoria: Shit, that's quite a lot.
Chris: You think? The PM begs to differ... 
Victoria: But how are you supposed to fulfil your duties the best you can with such a workload? It's ridiculous :/
Chris: I know, right? But who cares. I bet they're assigning new ones as we speak.
Victoria: I'm so sorry :( It'll pass, you'll see. It's always tough at this time of the year.
Chris: Yeah, I know, but I like this job and it bothers me that I'm not able to do my best. It's the first time that I'm really close to not giving a single fuck about this.
Victoria: It doesn't sound good. I would try talking with your manager once more. You know how it is, they're people as well, they need to be told they're doing something incredibly stupid sometimes.
Chris: Maybe your boss, mine is absolutely infallible :D",Chris is overwhelmed with work as he is involved in ten projects at the same time. The management at his company refuses to hire any new employees despite the growing workload. The situation is similar in the case of Victoria.

Jean: I'm not that stupid! I am very careful with medicines, you do remember that we were both nurses for 40 bloody years, don't you!
Joan: Yes, of course, but I know that when you're in pain it's easy to self-medicate and overdo it. Perhaps you should go to the Dr.

Joan: I'm the same, I do try and dodge her at church if possible, but she often seeks me out and I'm stuck for the whole morning, she insists on going to the Church Hall for coffees.
Jean: Perhaps we should try to find her a new husband! Your brother's a widower, isn't he? 
Joan: Bloody Nora! Can you imagine having Stella as your sister in law! No, I don't think Bill will be up for that!
Jean: Anyway, must go start dinner, see you next Weds, hopefully, back permitting.

Olga: It's called 'Mafia'
Vera: Sounds intriguing :) Can you describe how it works more less, please?
Vera: I invited some colleagues from my new job and hope to spend this time in a relaxed atmosphere
Olga: Sure, I'll try
Olga: So... It all comes down to playing various roles
Olga: You need to prepare little notes with the following roles written on them: 'mafia' (2 or 3 such notes), 'mayor', 'policeman' and the rest will be 'residents'
Olga: Everyone picks a random note
Olga: The game is led by a preselected person, let's call him a leader. There are 2 parts of the game - night and day
Olga: All the players sleep at night, I mean everyone closes their eyes
Olga: The leader says which character should wake up. Mafia wakes up every night and eliminates one player
Olga: The next one to wake up is mayor who can save a chosen player from death, including himself
Olga: Then a policeman wakes up and have an option of checking up on a chosen player by asking the leader if that person is a mafia member
Olga: Remember that nobody says anything - you make gestures to communicate 
Olga: Are you with me, Vera? :D
Vera: Sure, ofc, it shapes up well! Keep going, please :)
Olga: Sweet :)
Olga: So... The night ends and it's daytime now. A person indicated (killed) by mafia is out of the game and the players discuss who can be a perp
Olga: This is the most important element of the game because here the fun begins. The city seek to eliminate mafia and the mafia's trying to kill the mayor or the residents
Olga: And now the last thing that I should mention - the worst mistake while playing the game is to hurry.
Olga: You need to have plenty of time for Mafia. And trust me, it's addictive ;)
Vera: Wow, Olga, this all sounds fantastic!!
Vera: I'm sure everybody will like it

Melina: Hey!! I'm so sorry for not being in contact with you. I keep meaning to write, and having to put it off because of something or another. So how are you? Written anything new recently? I recently wrote a poem which I most soon... And I'm glad you wrote :) xx
Jada: I'm great! Today at school we learned hockey, and I discovered that I pretty good as a striker, but not as a goalie. :P So I posted my story so far on FictionPress, and another story, and a story that was chosen to be sent to a competition. Unfortunately, that story did not make it to the finals. :D I'm fine about it. My teacher was still proud of me. So what's your poem about? I've been reading more FanFiction things, I like reading them.

Melina: Lately I haven't been writing as much :( My creative juices are running pretty low. But I'm going to have to check out your stories!! :) Had any reviews yet? ANd well done for getting one sent to that competition! As for winning... there's always other opportunities :)
Jada: Oh, believe me, I prefer running too... I can;t join any after-school clubs, because my dad didn't want to learn how to drive in Hong Kong, since Hong Kong drove on the opposite side of Shanghai, aka on the right side of the road. My dad was afraid his instincts might come back again and he might start driving on the left side of the road, so we didn't but a car. And I was too lazy to join any other clubs, and besides, Battle of the Books was just reading. Just reading and memorizing authors and book names, which didn't appeal to me, even though I love reading.",Jada favourited Melina. Melina wrote a poem. Jada posted some stories on FictionPress but didn't make it to the finals of the competition. She can't join any after-school clubs.

Sam.Brown: Oh yes, we're fine. Ths. Only these tons of apples this year! We don't know what to do with them. What are you doing?
Oliver: We've manged to sell the lot to wine grower in our village. We managed to talk him into experimenting with cider. It's a great drink, cheap and tasty, and nobody produces it here in the region. So a new business idea!
Sam.Brown: A bit risky eh?
Oliver: Not really. We've put some money in it but we don't think there'll be losses. At the worst we'll break even.
Sam.Brown: Is it the same person who pressed your apples for juice last year?
Oliver: No. He's a wine producer. The other one's a fruit grower. He's got these fruit plantations east of Dillon.
Sam.Brown: I see. Do you think he could take our apples and press them for us? I'd love to have my own apple juice.
Oliver: I may ask if you want. He only takes organic apples, you know. But yours are.
Sam.Brown: Sure they are! Never seen any chemicals in their life.
Oliver: If you have too much apple, why don't you join us in the cider business? Wouldn't Mike be interested?
Sam.Brown: Not sure. We're so clumsy with money, you know. But I'll ask. D'you want his mobile number? Why don't you talk to him directly?
Sam.Brown: 0167 287 43 12 Michael Brown
Oliver: Thanks! I'll call him. We could still do with more apples but they have to be absolutely and doubtlessly organic. Of course I know your trees. They're clean.

Oliver: And tasty. And healthy. Samantha, great to chat with you. We'll be in touch again soon.
